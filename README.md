This is the start of a list I am making (off the top of my head) on how to have an online experience free of prying eyes.
Eventually I want to make this repo a more comprehensive source for learning to compute online securely.

- check out prism-break.org
- use linux instead of windows & ios.  [windows](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/microsoft-programmed-in-nsa-backdoor-in-windows-by-1999.html)
- use featurephone or linux phone instead of smartphone no android, winphones & iphones.
- use duckduckgo or ixquick.com as search, dump google
- for webmail dump gmail, yahoo, hotmail, etc
- say no to cloud storage like dropbox, google drive, or learn how to set one up yourself
- say no to cloud anything - providers can have secret arrangements that violate their own terms of service.
- tape over all cams and disable microphones in all devices
- get rid of digital TV and use LCD not connected to any external providers 
- shop on prepaid cards.  use money orders and cash
- roll your only certificate authority.  don't trust Verisign, GoDaddy, etc.
- use perfect forward secrecy - unless this is a google/NSA collab?
- Avoid all social networking, photo sharing, and online forums.  
- [Tor Project] (https://www.torproject.org)
- 4096 bit encryption minimum.  Are we doomed against quantum efforts?
- store private keys offline
- key signing must be done in person via stand alone systems


If I have bad or mis-information send me a PR, open an issue, and we will together as a community solidify this repo.
